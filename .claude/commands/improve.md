# Record Workflow Improvement

Use this to record learnings and improve our workflow over time.

## Ask the User
"What workflow improvement or learning should I remember for future sessions?"

Examples:
- "Always check B2 bandwidth caps first when audio fails"
- "User prefers smaller commits with immediate deploys"
- "Run build before deploy to catch TypeScript errors"

## Update Memory
Add the improvement to the "ReplayWorkflow" entity in memory.

## Confirm
Tell the user what was saved and that it will be loaded in future `/resume` commands.
